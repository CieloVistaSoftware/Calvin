Beginner's Guide to Markdown in Visual Studio Code
Markdown is a lightweight markup language used for formatting text. Here’s how to get started with it in Visual Studio Code:

Install Markdown Support:

VS Code natively supports Markdown, but you can install additional extensions like “Markdown All in One” for more features.
Basic Syntax:

Headers: Use # for headers. For example: # Heading 1, ## Heading 2.
Bold: **bold text**
Italic: *italic text*
Lists:
Unordered: - Item
Ordered: 1. Item

## Preview:

Click on Preview (Ctrl+Shift+V) to view the rendered Markdown file.
Code Blocks:


Here’s how you can format text using Markdown and what it looks like:

1. Headers:
Markdown:

markdown
Copy code
# This is Heading 1
## This is Heading 2
### This is Heading 3
Result:

This is Heading 1
This is Heading 2
This is Heading 3
2. Bold and Italic:
Markdown:

markdown
Copy code
**This text is bold**
*This text is italic*
Result: This text is bold
This text is italic

3. Unordered List:
Markdown:

markdown
Copy code
- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3
Result:

Item 1
Item 2
Item 3
4. Code Block:
Markdown:

markdown
Copy code
```python
def greet():
    print("Hello, World!")
greet()
css
Copy code

Result:
```python
def greet():
    print("Hello, World!")

This shows how you would write markdown, followed by the expected rendering!
